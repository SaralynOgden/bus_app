Providing metrics about what bus near you is the most reliable

There's no denying that we have much to be thankful for when it comes to the King County Metro. For many of us, it takes us to work and picks us up at the end of the day. Its our means of getting to and from events all over the city. At BusTrends, we believe its critical to understand what buses are reliable and what buses somehow continually have problems. By gaining these insights, you won't ever have to worry about being late to that next meeting or god forbid, miss the start of the next hawks game.

How does it work?

Based on your bus route, bus number and what time periods you prefer to catch your bus, we can track which one will get you to your destination with less surprises along the way.
